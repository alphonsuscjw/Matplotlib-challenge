Pymaceuticals, Inc. specialises in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. In a study, 249 mice diagnosed with SCC were given a range of drug regimens for treatment over the course of 45 days and tumour development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
